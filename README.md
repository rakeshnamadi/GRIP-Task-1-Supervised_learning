# GRIP_Supervised_learning

Now I am doing internship in spark foundation GRIP
As per my tasks I need to work on different problem statements
So, I worked on supervised learning
Problem: To predict the score of a student based on their study hours
Though dataset is small I used linear regression under sklearn to make the model
I used seaborn and matplotlib libraries to visulaize the data.

Accuracy score is 0.9696126973726618
Mean Absolute Error: 4.011912571964117

User input 1
No of Hours = 9.25
Predicted Score = 93.28923969
user input 2
No of Hours = 8.23
Predicted Score = 83.20718018
